# Simple_AV

## Overview

**Simple_AV** is an autonomous vehicle simulation project designed to integrate various modules, including perception, localization, planning, and control, within a simulated environment provided by AWSIM. The primary purpose of this project is to create a functional and modular autonomous vehicle system that can interact with a simulated environment, enabling testing and development in a controlled setting. Simple_AV offers a simplified alternative to Autoware for autonomous vehicle control. Built with simplicity and flexibility in mind, Simple_AV provides a straightforward approach to vehicle navigation and control, making it an ideal choice for developers seeking a lightweight solution without sacrificing functionality.

For a detailed explanation of the project, please refer to the [documentation](https://hoosh-ir.github.io/simple_av/) hosted on GitHub Pages.

- **simple_av_msgs/**: Defines internal message types used for communication between the Simple_AV nodes.
- **.github/workflows/**: Contains the GitHub Actions workflows for Continuous Integration (CI) and deployment of the documentation.
- **docs/**: The source files for the project documentation, written using MkDocs.
- **mkdocs.yml**: The configuration file for MkDocs, which defines the structure and theme of the documentation site.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you'll need to set up a ROS 2 workspace and clone the necessary packages.

### Step 0: Setup the Environment.
Refer to the [simple av system setup page](https://hoosh-ir.github.io/simple_av/Simple-AV/SystemSetup/) in the Simple_AV documentation for detailed instructions.

### Step 1: Create a ROS Workspace

First, create a new ROS workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/src
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Next, clone this repository into the src directory of your workspace:
```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/hoosh-ir/simple_av.git
```

### Step 3: Build the Workspace

After cloning the repository, build the workspace using colcon:
```bash
cd ~/ros_ws/
colcon build
```

The workspace should look like this after running `colcon build`:
```bash
ros_ws/
├── build/
├── install/
├── log/
└── src/
    ├── docs/
    ├── mkdocs.yml
    ├── README.md
    └── src/
      ├── V2X_messages/
      ├── simple_av_msgs/
      ├── common/
      ├── system/
      ├── control/
      ├── localization/
      ├── planning/
      ├── perception/
      └── simple_av/
          ├── package.xml
          ├── resource/
          ├── setup.cfg
          ├── setup.py
          └── launch/
              └── launch_all.py
```

### Step 4: Source the Workspace

Finally, source the workspace to make the ROS packages available:
```bash
source ~/ros_ws/install/setup.bash
```

### Step 5: Running the project

You can run the project by either running the launch file or by manually starting each node in sequence.

Run the launch file:
```bash
ros2 launch simple_av launch_all.py
```

Or, run the nodes manually in the following order:
```bash
ros2 run localization localization
ros2 run localization intersection_detector
ros2 run system portal
ros2 run system sim_monitor
ros2 run perception traffic_light_handler
ros2 run perception object_detection_handler
ros2 run planning mission_planning
ros2 run planning behavior_path_planning
ros2 run planning behavior_motion_planning
ros2 run control control
```
